## Data

The below plots are made by processing data obtained from <https://data.gov.in/node/3994481>. The data contains the frequencies of Cyclonic Disturbances observed in Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Land from 1890 to 2016.

## Plots

### Scatter Plot

![Cyclonic Disturbances in Bay of Bengal & Arabian Sea (1891-2015)](images/scatter.png)

**Observation**:\

Above box plot which consist of data from 125 years shows that Cyclonic Disturbances happen most frequently in mansoon season and very rarely during winter

### Bar Plot
